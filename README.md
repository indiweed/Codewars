1. bonusTime
It's bonus time in the big city! The fatcats are rubbing their paws in anticipation... but who is going to make the most money?

Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.

If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary
Return the total figure the individual will receive as a string prefixed with "Â£"

2. consonantCount
Complete the function that takes a string of English-language text and returns the number of consonants in the string.

Consonants are all letters used to write English excluding the vowels a, e, i, o, u.

3. Sum of Digits / Digital Root 
Digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number.

Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. The input will be a non-negative integer.

4. Three sticks
Imagine that you are given two sticks. You want to end up with three sticks of equal length. You are allowed to cut either or both of the sticks to accomplish this, and can throw away leftover pieces.

Write a function, maxlen, that takes the lengths of the two sticks (L1 and L2, both positive values), that will return the maximum length you can make the three sticks.

5. Range Extraction
A format for expressing an ordered list of integers is to use a comma separated list of either

individual integers
or a range of integers denoted by the starting integer separated from the end integer in the range by a dash, '-'. The range includes all integers in the interval including both endpoints. It is not considered a range unless it spans at least 3 numbers. For example "12,13,15-17"
Complete the solution so that it takes a list of integers in increasing order and returns a correctly formatted string in the range format.

6. The Hashtag Generator
The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

Here's the deal:

It must start with a hashtag (#).
All words must have their first letter capitalized.
If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
If the input or the result is an empty string it must return false.

7. Number of trailing zeros of N!
Write a program that will calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial of a given number.
